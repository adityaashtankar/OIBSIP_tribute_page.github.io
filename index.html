        <h1>ODI</h1>
        <p>
          Virat Kohli is an Indian cricketer who is widely regarded as one of
          the best batsmen in the world. He has achieved remarkable success in
          One Day Internationals (ODIs) and has numerous records to his
          name.Kohli holds several records in ODI cricket. As of September 2021,
          he has the fastest century in ODIs, reaching the milestone in just 52
          balls against Australia. He also holds the record for the fastest
          player to score 8,000, 9,000, 10,000, and 11,000 runs in ODI cricket.
          In addition, Kohli has the most centuries in successful run-chases in
          ODI history. Kohli has been a prolific run-scorer for India in ODIs
          and has played a crucial role in the team's success. He has
          consistently maintained a high batting average and has been a reliable
          anchor for the Indian batting lineup. His ability to chase down
          targets and perform under pressure has earned him a reputation as a
          reliable match-winner.

        <h1>Test</h1>
        <p>
          Kohli holds several records in Test cricket. He is the fastest player
          to score 8,000, 9,000, 10,000, and 11,000 runs in terms of innings
          played. He also holds the record for the most double centuries as a
          captain for India. Additionally, Kohli has the highest number of
          centuries while chasing in Test cricket. Under Kohli's captaincy, the
          Indian Test team achieved significant milestones, including a historic
          series victory in Australia in 2018-19, where India became the first
          Asian team to win a Test series Down Under. Kohli has been a vital cog
          in India's batting lineup and has been known for his aggressive
          approach and ability to dominate the opposition bowlers. His
          consistency and ability to score runs in all conditions have earned
          him accolades and recognition as one of the best batsmen in the world.

        <img src="t20.webp" />
        <h1>T20</h1>
        <p>
          Virat Kohli's performance in T20 cricket has also been impressive.
          While he has primarily made a name for himself in Test and ODI
          formats, he has made notable contributions in T20 internationals as
          well. Kohli has achieved several milestones in T20 cricket. He is the
          leading run-scorer for India in T20 internationals and has the most
          centuries in the format. He also holds the record for the fastest
          player to score 1,000, 2,000, and 3,000 runs in T20 internationals.
          Kohli's batting style in T20s is characterized by his ability to find
          gaps and rotate the strike, combining excellent technique with
          innovative shot-making. While he may not possess the power-hitting
          capabilities of some other T20 specialists, his ability to construct
          innings and play calculated shots has made him a formidable presence
          in the format.
